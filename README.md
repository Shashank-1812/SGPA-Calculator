A console-based python application for calculating academic grades and performance for students enrolled in different courses and semesters.
It allows users to navigate through various semesters, input subject-wise marks, and obtain a detailed performance summary.
The code incorporates functions for clearing the console screen, waiting for user input, displaying course and semester menus, validating 
and obtaining marks and credits, calculating grade points, and determining the overall grade and SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average).
It follows a modular structure, separating functionalities into different functions, making the code organized and readable. The program utilizes
a grading system based on percentage ranges, and it calculates SGPA based on the obtained grade points and total credits. The user can input marks
for individual subjects, and the program provides detailed academic results, including total marks, percentage, and the final grade for a given semester.
